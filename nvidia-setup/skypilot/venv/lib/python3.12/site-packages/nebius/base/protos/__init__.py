"""Protobuf helper utilities for the Nebius SDK.

This package provides lightweight helpers that wrap protobuf descriptors and
generated message classes used throughout the SDK. The helpers focus on
introspection (descriptor lookups) and convenience wrappers rather than
implementing the protobuf runtime itself.
